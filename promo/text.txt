---------DESCRIPTION:----------

Virtual Pet Dog is a cute , animated pet on your watch that you can power up with your steps!

Modeled after a real rescue dog, this virtual dog has all the characteristics of a Pomeranian, Sheltie, and Spitz. 'Butterball', a real puppy from California, was used as the inspiration and model for the design. This virtual dog is full of happy energy, but sleeps more than the other virtual dogs. He is easily frightened, likes to bark, likes junk food, gets sick sometimes, and likes to cause trouble!

Have fun exercising as this little dog gains hearts while you reach your goals. The virtual dog has three modes: sitting, walking, and sleeping. Based on your activity levels the dog will change what it does throughout the day and will have different moods.
